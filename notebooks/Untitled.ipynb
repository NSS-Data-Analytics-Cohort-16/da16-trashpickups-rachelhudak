I have video surveillance  cameras that show every street location of all the neighbor garbage cans.  I went back on the video and saw that every can within site of my cameras were emptied except mine.  The driver drove by my two cans twice, within 10 to 12 feet of them,  without ever slowing down.  He emptied my next door neighbors can, He emptied the can across the street from where my cans were and he went up and down the streets emptying everyone\\'s cans but mine.  This is not the first time this has happened.  I even watched him drive by my cans once when I was outside watching.  I stopped him on the way out of the neighborhood and asked the driver way he didn\\'t empty mine.  His answer was \"Oh, I guess I didn\\'t see them\".  Isn\\'t that his job?  To look for cans at the curb so he can empty them.  My cans were at the curb, the view of them was not obstructed by vehicles, bushes or anything else.  The road was not obstructed by any parked vehicles to prevent him from getting to them.  My cans are full and I want them picked up by Tuesday morning.  Yeah Tuesday, because of the holiday I guess all pick up people are off.  If the cans are not picked up by Tuesday I\\'ll be calling my councilman and asking for an investigation.  I\\'ll be saving the surveillance footage for anyone who cares to see it can.', 'My trash has been skipped two weeks in a row.
